Bubli a pretty basic bot with few cognitive abilities, but it's still an excellent way to chat. 

```diff
- Bhojpuri, oh yes bhojpuri
+ Sarcastically beautiful
! Essence of local
# A language full of double meanings
@@ ka ho (ka hal ba)@@

Inherit beauty of the bhojpuri language is -- you can easily twist it
kal hal ba
hal ka ba
ba ka hal

! All of the meanings remain the same ;) but proceed with caution â€”- there might be a hidden double meaning :P

## Motivation

I am a native speaker of Bhojpuri, a lovely north Indian language. I wanted to talk to a chatbot just for fun. Bubli is one of my first chatbot projects, built using natural language processing. I am working on v0.2 with new cool features, stay tuned ...

### Why named 'Bubli'

Names are crucial to our personal identities. They are linked by strong personal, cultural, familial, and historical ties. They also help us understand who we are, where we fit in the world, and what communities we are a part of. I was inspired to name it 'Bubli' after a popular funny bhojpuri song called "hum bulbi bola tani"
